        Middlegame attacks are often the most exciting phase of the chess game.
        On this page, you will be able to review a number of different strategic themes for attacking an opponent.
        By playing through these patterns, you will be able to recognize such possibilities in your own game --
        either to bring them about or, if you are being attacked, to be able to prevent them. Just as important,
        you should be able to get a sense that successful attacks require careful coordination among many pieces,
        not just one or two. Sacrifices are special kings of attacks in which one player gives up or "sacrifices"
        material, perhaps as little as a pawn or as much as a Queen, in order to generate an attack.
        This page will review a number of common sacrifices that can occur in your own games.
