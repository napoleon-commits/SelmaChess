    body: `
        The King and Queen are the tow strongest pieces. The Queen has tremendous scope, especially in the open board,
        but it is important not to bring the Queen out too early. If you do, you might find that your opponent is able
        to attack the Queen and make it move again and again, often a clear waste of time. The King, of course, is the most
        important piece. If it is attacked and has no escape, you lose the game. Therefor, you typically want to safeguard your King
        before you begin your attacks. In most games, you will usually want to castle to safeguard your King and activate a Rook.
        Once castled, try not to move the pawns in front of your King.
