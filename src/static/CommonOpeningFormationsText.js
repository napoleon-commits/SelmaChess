        To improve in chess, it helps to be able to recognize certain pawn structures
        and have a coordinated plan for how to proceed.
        On this page several different structures and opening formations are presented.
        Most are relatively easy to set up and can be very effective even in the hands of a relatively
        inexperienced player. As you will see, every structure has its strengths and weaknesses.
        Understanding the role of each piece within the structure will help guide your play.
