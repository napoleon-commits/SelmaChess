        Unlike Kings, Queens, Bishops, Knights, and Rooks, pawns can move in only one direction:
        forward, ever forward. Reach the final rank and the lowly pawn, the foot soldier of chess, can transform itself
        into any piece except a King.
        But there is much more to pawns than just the quest to promote into a more powerful piece.
        As the pawns move forward, they open up diagonals for the Bishops, protect other pieces,
        and often lead the way for attacks. They can pry open an opponent's Kingside, but they can also spell doom
        when they become weak, and are then subject to capture.
