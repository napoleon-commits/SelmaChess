        The Bishop is forever committed to traveling on the same color.
        To make sure the Bishop will have the most substantial effect on the position,
        it is important to not fix your pawns on the color of your Bishop.
        In an open board where the pawns are mobile, the Bishop can be a very powerful piece.
        You will soon see pins, skewers, and Bishops that can dominate Knights and even Rooks.
        However, in a closed position where many of the pawns are fixes,
        the Bishop's mobility can be seriously limited.
