        The most exciting phase of the game of chess is the attacks leading to checkmate
        or to gain the substantial material. On this page,
        you will be able to review a number of different patterns for attacking an opponent.
        By playing through these patterns, you will learn to recognize such possibilities in your own game --
        either how to bring about the attacks or how to stop them.

                the back rank mate can be easy or surprisingly difficult.
