        A Rook is a powerful piece. This page will help you learn how to make the most of it.
        Some chess players find it difficult to develop the Rooks effectively because the Rooks
        begin the game in the corners. Developing your pieces quickly and moving the Rooks toward
        the central files will help you secure control over the center of the board. And by attacking
        or controlling distant squares, the Rooks can help your attacks succeed. Experienced players know
        that Rooks belong on open files
        and that Rooks are especially effective when they get to the 7th rank to attack the enemy pawns.
