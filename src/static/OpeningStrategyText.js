        Now that you know how to set up the board and how to move and activate the pieces and pawns,
        it's time to start putting it all together. Playing chess is very much like being a commander in a war.
        You are in control of all the pices. Some beginners make the mistake of bringing out only or two pieces,
        while leaving the rest
        of their army on their original squares. To play a good game,
        it's important to try to coordinate all of the pieces in your army.
