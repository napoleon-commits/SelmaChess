        The beginning moves of a chess game are called the opening.
        Some players spend years memorizing long opening variations,
        but you can get far in chess with a firm understanding of just a few key principles.
        Make sure that you fight for control of the center of the board.
        In your fight for the center, try to limit the number of your pawn moves.
        Before you attack, try to develop most of your pieces on squares that help control
        the center and from which they can't easily be attacked.
