        To win a chess game, you must deliver a checkmate --
        placing your opponent's King in check with the King having no legal move. On this page,
        you will be able to explore all the most basic checkmates. Some of these checkmates are very simple.
        In fact, if you're clever enough to Queen a pawn,
        the checkmate with two Queens against a lone King is easy and fun to do.
        The other checkmates listed are somewhat more challenging.
